# Paul Sample, Beaver Meadow

Paul Sample, Dartmouth Class of 1920, was artist in-residence at the College from 1938 to 1962 and lived in Norwich, Vermont. This landscape depicts the small settlement within the rural township of Norwich known as Beaver Meadow. One of Sampleâ€™s most admired works, it is an eloquent expression of the aesthetics and ideals of the regionalist movement of the 1930s.
