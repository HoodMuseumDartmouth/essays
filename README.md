Paul Sample, Dartmouth Class of 1920, was artist in-residence at the College from 1938 to 1962 and lived in Norwich, Vermont. This landscape depicts the small settlement within the rural township of Norwich known as Beaver Meadow. One of Sample’s most admired works, it is an eloquent expression of the aesthetics and ideals of the regionalist movement of the 1930s. 

Its lean, decorative composition, stripped of extraneous detail, recalls popular illustration, caricature, and American folk art traditions. In it, Sample celebrates qualities associated with a stereotypical Vermont village: the harmonious relationships between humans and nature, as reflected in the tidy fields and farm buildings nestled in the hills, and among the members of this apparently idyllic settlement, whose sense of community is strengthened through weekly worship. Yet the picture also evokes an undercurrent of unease, and even suspicion, that is suggested by the rigidity of the figures in the foreground and their detachment from one another. Like the work of his Midwestern counterpart Grant Wood, Sample’s depiction of his neighbors can be read as both admiring and mildly satirical, suggesting a more complex response to his environs than the all-out boosterism generally associated with the regionalist aesthetic.

Norwich, Vermont is now a place where very rich people live. That line will in no way make it to the public [an image from Wikimedia commons](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Norwich-Vermont-Bragg_Hill-Autumn.jpg/450px-Norwich-Vermont-Bragg_Hill-Autumn.jpg).  In order to get the flyto animation linked with an image, I need to geotag an image in a repo with the coordinates in exiftool. I do not have that repo.

I could also not find the correct geographic coordinates for something called Beaver Meadow in Norwich, but that would be super awesome if I could. Then I could put a side-by-side comparison of the two.
